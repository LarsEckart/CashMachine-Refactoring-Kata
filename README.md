Bank Account
============

Some sample code that breaks the Law of Demeter.

It can be used as an alternative "Connect" exercise for this [Learning Hour on the Law of Demeter](https://www.sammancoaching.org/learning_hours/refactoring/law_of_demeter.html). Show the code in Bank Account and ask "What could go wrong?". Hopefully they will spot the public field. Then follow up by asking "What is encapsulation?"

Then in the concept part of the Learning Hour you can show the code in CashMachine and ask "What could go wrong?". Hopefully they will spot the [MessageChain](https://www.sammancoaching.org/code_smells/message_chains.html) code smell. Follow up with "What is the Law of Demeter?". Then you can explain what that is.
